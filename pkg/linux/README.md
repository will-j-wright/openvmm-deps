# Linux Kernel Configuration

This directory contains the kernel configs and build script for the OpenVMM
test kernels. These kernels are used by the petri test framework with Linux
direct boot (`Firmware::LinuxDirect`).

The build is structured to support multiple kernel lines side-by-side.
Today **6.1** (LTS), **6.18**, **cca-v15**, **snp-guest**, and **mshv-host**
ship; additional lines can be added purely additively (see "Adding a new
kernel version" below). The CCA line is Arm-only and ships for `aarch64`
only. The MSHV host and SNP guest lines ship for `x86_64` only. Each kernel
is published as its own GitHub release artifact
(`openvmm-test-linux-<version>.<arch>.<release>.tar.gz`) containing the
kernel images and final config. The initrd is shared across all kernels
and ships as its own `openvmm-test-initrd.<arch>.<release>.tar.gz`
artifact (so it isn't redundantly bundled into every kernel tarball).

    x86_64.config         # SEV-SNP guest kernel / x86_64
    required.config       # Settings the SNP guest boot needs
    patches/              # SNP guest patches applied to the source
  mshv-host/
    x86_64.config         # MSHV root-partition host kernel / x86_64
    required.config       # Settings the Azure MSHV host needs
```

The version selection is driven by `$LINUX_VERSION`, which is exported by
the corresponding `sysroots/linux-<version>/deps` file (a single line of
the form `LINUX_VERSION=<version>`, picked up by `pkg/Tools/build.sh`'s env
handling). The Dockerfile pins one source-tree commit per kernel line
(`src-linux-6.1`, etc.) and bind-mounts the matching source into the
corresponding `build-linux-<version>` stage.

A kernel line can also set these options in its deps file:

- `LINUX_SOURCE_REVISION` and `LINUX_SOURCE_EPOCH` make the build
  reproducible and write `manifest.txt` with the kernel release and hashes.
- `LINUX_MODULES=1` builds the modules and installs them, stripped and
  signed, under `lib/modules/<release>/` in the artifact. The build requires
  `CONFIG_MODULES=y`. The module signing key is generated per build and is
  not exported.

A line can carry patches in `pkg/linux/<version>/patches/`. `patch.sh`
applies them in filename order with no fuzz. The line's Dockerfile source
mount must be read-write (`rw`).

A line can also list settings in `pkg/linux/<version>/required.config`.
The build fails if the resolved config does not contain each setting.

The **cca-v15** line uses one exact `cca-host/v15` source commit and one union
configuration. The same image supports QEMU and FVP L1 hosts, nested Realm
guests, and the generic AArch64 TCG VFIO/P2P tests.

The **snp-guest** line is the L2 guest kernel for OpenVMM tests on MSHV with
SEV-SNP. It builds the stable `v6.18.53` tag. Its config seed is
`Microsoft/configs/x86/uvm_defconfig` from the Azure Linux kata-uvm tag
`rolling-lts/kata-uvm/6.18.52.mshv1` (commit `ce4c4c2d`) in
[CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel),
resolved by this build. The patches come from the
[`snp-6.18-guest-unregister`](https://github.com/chris-oo/CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel/tree/snp-6.18-guest-unregister)
branch, rebased onto `v6.18.53`:

| Patch | Upstream commit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `0001` | `8e6fbce7` | Unregister the decompressor GHCB before making its page private. |
| `0002` | `a8b36965` | Enable x2APIC early, before the boot CPU APIC ID is read. |
| `0003` | `6e82e92b` | Allocate hypercall output pages for SNP AP startup. |

Patch `0001` uses the GHCB 2.04 Unregister GHCB GPA protocol when the
hypervisor advertises it (feature bit 8). OpenVMM's MSHV backend supports it.
On a hypervisor without it, the guest falls back to the upstream cleanup
path. Boot-critical settings in `required.config` must stay built in,
because the artifact does not ship modules.

The **mshv-host** line is the L1 kernel for Azure Linux Dom0 test runners.
It builds commit `f10394f7` from the `user/cho/mshv-snp-normal-injection`
branch of CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel: `rolling-lts/mshv/6.18.34.mshv3` plus the
SNP interrupt injection policy UAPI that OpenVMM uses. Its config is that
commit's `Microsoft/configs/x86/mshv_defconfig`, resolved by this build.

The line sets `LINUX_MODULES=1`, so the artifact includes signed modules
under `lib/modules/<release>/`. Install the kernel and modules on the runner,
then generate its initramfs there. Each build generates a new module signing
key and embeds its certificate in the kernel, so the images and modules are
not byte-for-byte reproducible.

The package builder has no `pahole`, so the resolved config drops BTF
(`DEBUG_INFO_BTF`) and the options that depend on it. The MSHV tests do not
need BTF.

## Updating a kernel config

The build runs `make olddefconfig` inside the container using the musl
cross-compiler toolchain. To ensure the committed config exactly matches
what the build uses, always extract the final config from the build output
rather than running `olddefconfig` locally (which uses your host compiler
and produces toolchain-dependent noise in the diff).

### Via CI (recommended)

The easiest way to update configs across all architectures and kernel
versions at once is to let CI do the build and then pull the resolved
configs back:

1. Edit the config file(s) directly (e.g., change `# CONFIG_FOO is not set`
   to `CONFIG_FOO=y`) under `pkg/linux/<version>/`.

2. Commit, push your branch, and wait for the CI build to complete.

3. Run the sync script to download the final configs from the CI artifacts:

   ```bash
   # Uses the latest CI run for the current branch:
   pkg/linux/sync-configs-from-ci.sh

   # Or specify a run ID:
   pkg/linux/sync-configs-from-ci.sh 12345
   ```

4. Review the resolved changes and push:

   ```bash
   git diff pkg/linux/
   git add pkg/linux/ && git commit -m "sync resolved kernel configs from CI" && git push
   ```

### Locally (single arch/version)

If you prefer to build locally (e.g., for a quick iteration on one combo):

1. Edit the config file directly (e.g., change `# CONFIG_FOO is not set` to
   `CONFIG_FOO=y`) under `pkg/linux/<version>/`.

2. Build the kernel for the target architecture:

   ```bash
   # For x86_64 / 6.1:
   docker build --platform linux/amd64 --target result-linux-6.1 \
     --output type=local,dest=out/linux-6.1 -f Dockerfile .

   # For aarch64 / 6.1:
   docker build --platform linux/arm64 --target result-linux-6.1 \
     --output type=local,dest=out/linux-6.1 -f Dockerfile .
   ```

3. Copy the final config (produced by `olddefconfig` inside the build) back
   into the source tree:

   ```bash
   # For x86_64 / 6.1:
   cp out/linux-6.1/config pkg/linux/6.1/x86_64.config

   # For aarch64 / 6.1:
   cp out/linux-6.1/config pkg/linux/6.1/aarch64.config
   ```

4. Review the diff, commit, and push.

## Adding a new kernel version

> **Important:** before merging a new kernel version (or bumping an
> existing one's pinned commit across a major LTS boundary), always run
> the bootstrap below and commit the resulting `olddefconfig`-resolved
> configs. The seeded configs are starting points only — they may carry
> stale options, and `CONFIG_WERROR=y` means new compiler warnings under
> the musl GCC toolchain will become hard build failures if unaddressed.

1. Look up the latest commit on the desired LTS branch in
   `gregkh/linux` (e.g. `linux-6.12.y`).
2. In `Dockerfile`, add a new `src-linux-<ver>` stage pinning that commit,
   and a `build-linux-<ver>` / `result-linux-<ver>` pair modeled on the
   existing 6.1 ones. Add a corresponding `COPY --from=result-linux-<ver>`
   line to `output-base` (both architectures), `output-x86_64`, or
   `output-aarch64`.
3. Create `sysroots/linux-<ver>/deps` containing
   `LINUX_VERSION=<ver>` and `pkg/linux`.
4. Seed `pkg/linux/<ver>/{x86_64,aarch64}.config` by copying from the
   nearest existing version, then follow the "Updating a kernel config"
   procedure above to bootstrap the canonical config from the in-build
   `olddefconfig` output.
5. Add an `archive` line for the new version to the matching
   `package-x86_64` or `package-aarch64` stage in `Dockerfile`. The release
   job uploads every generated tarball, so no workflow change is required.
6. Run `python3 pkg/Tools/gen-cgmanifest.py` to refresh `cgmanifest.json`.

## Build

The `build.sh` script copies the chosen config to `.config`, runs
`make olddefconfig` (to resolve dependencies and fill in defaults), builds
the kernel, and exports the final `.config` alongside the kernel images.
See the top-level `README.md` for build instructions.
